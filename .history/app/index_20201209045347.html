        <p style="color: #ffd166; font-size: 10px">The overall loudness of a track in decibels (dB). Loudness values are
          averaged across the entire track and are useful for comparing relative loudness of tracks. Loudness is the
          quality of a sound that is the primary psychological correlate of physical strength (amplitude).</p>
        <p style="color: #ffd166; font-size: 10px">Danceability describes how suitable a track is for dancing based on a
          combination of
          musical elements
          including tempo, rhythm stability, beat strength, and overall regularity. A value of 0.0 is least danceable
          and 1.0 is most danceable.</p>
        <p>The progression of music <strong>loudness</strong> and <strong>danceability</strong> over the years gives
          insight into what people are valuing in their music choice.</p>
